# Baddie +297

> **Warning**
Since all similar apps have been DMCA'd (or what-have-you) and I no longer play, I wanted to finally publish this for posterity. It wasn't really written with the intention of being read by other people, but I thought the functionality (especially on the frontend) was nice, so I want it to be out there.

Monster search engine for Puzzle and Dragons.

Build and run with `docker-compose build; docker-compose up`.

Serves app at port `80`.
